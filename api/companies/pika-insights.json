  "description": "Pika Insights exists because 90% of sales in Africa are recorded with pen and paper, making the data inaccessible to corporates. This is the informal trade, a $1 trillion dollar market that is expected to double in two years. But the small shops that make up this sector, cannot present data to vouch for their businesses. We offer them a bookkeeping app that improves their data, reduces risk for lenders, and generates data we sell to multiple industries for marketing and sales intelligence.",
